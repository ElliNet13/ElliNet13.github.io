Whispering Leaves\n---------------------\n\nThe leaves are whispering secrets,\nAs they tumble from the trees,\nIn hues of red, orange, and gold,\nCarried by the cool, brisk breeze.\n\nTheir dance is a final farewell,\nTo the warmth of summer days,\nThey blanket the earth so gently,\nIn a soft and rustling haze.\n\n2. Crisp Mornings\n-----------------\n\nMornings crisp with promise,\nThe air is fresh and clean,\nFog clings to the valleys,\nNature's well-worn routine.\n\nThe sun peeks through the branches,\nCasting shadows long and lean,\nA world transformed by autumn,\nIn a palette serene.\n\n3. Harvest Moon\n---------------\n\nBeneath the shining harvest moon,\nFields of gold and amber glow,\nThe farmers toil from dawn til dusk,\nAs the days grow short and slow.\n\nThe moonlight bathes the rolling hills,\nIn a soft and silver sheen,\nA celestial dance of shadow and light,\nIn a world so serene.\n\n4. The Scent of Cinnamon\n------------------------\n\nThe scent of cinnamon fills the air,\nMixed with cloves and pumpkin spice,\nAn autumn feast of memories,\nSo warm and so precise.\n\nFrom cozy kitchens filled with love,\nTo orchards ripe with fruit,\nThe flavors of this cherished time,\nAre as timeless as the root.\n\n5. Winds of Change\n------------------\n\nThe winds of change are blowing,\nThrough the branches, soft and low,\nThey carry whispers of the past,\nAnd tales of long ago.\n\nThe world is shifting, turning,\nAs seasons come and go,\nBut in the heart of autumn,\nThere's a stillness we all know.\n\n6. Bonfire Nights\n-----------------\n\nBonfire nights in autumn's chill,\nWith crackling wood and laughter loud,\nGathered close, we tell our tales,\nBeneath a starry shroud.\n\nThe flames dance high, the smoke curls up,\nA signal to the skies,\nOn nights like these, with friends so dear,\nTime almost seems to fly.\n\n7. Autumn's Embrace\n-------------------\n\nIn autumn's tender embrace,\nWe find a kind of peace,\nA rhythm slow and steady,\nWhere busy lives can cease.\n\nThe world is hushed in colors,\nThat speak to every heart,\nIn autumn's gentle whisper,\nWe're reminded how to start.\n\n8. Migration\n------------\n\nOverhead, the V forms high,\nAs geese honk their goodbyes,\nThey travel south in search of warmth,\nBeneath the autumn skies.\n\nTheir journey is a timeless one,\nA passage through the year,\nThey teach us about moving on,\nYet keeping what is dear.\n\n9. A Fading Light\n-----------------\n\nAs daylight slowly fades away,\nAnd nights grow longer still,\nWe walk beneath the twilight glow,\nExperiencing autumn's thrill.\n\nThe world prepares for winter's rest,\nA slumber long and deep,\nBut for now, in autumn's warmth,\nWe savor what we keep.\n\n10. Reflections\n---------------\n\nAs autumn paints the world anew,\nWith brushstrokes bright and bold,\nWe find ourselves reflecting,\nOn stories yet untold.\n\nThe season tells a tale of change,\nOf beauty in the end,\nAs leaves fall down to nurture life,\nIn a circle without end.\n\n========================\n\n**End of Autumn Poetry Collection**\n```\n\nFeel free to add, modify, or customize these poems to better fit your vision or personal style."]},"lists":{},"broadcasts":{},"customVars":[],"blocks":{"o":{"opcode":"event_whenstageclicked","next":"c","parent":null,"inputs":{},"fields":{},"topLevel":true},"c":{"opcode":"looks_switchbackdropto","next":"i","parent":"o","inputs":{"BACKDROP":[1,"p"]},"fields":{}},"p":{"opcode":"looks_backdrops","next":null,"parent":"c","inputs":{},"fields":{"BACKDROP":["backdrop2","F,Ao47G-eQE++gxnGW,+"]},"shadow":true},"i":{"opcode":"text_clearText","next":"d","parent":"c","inputs":{},"fields":{}},"d":{"opcode":"data_setvariableto","next":"e","parent":"i","inputs":{"VALUE":[3,"q",[10,"0"]]},"fields":{"VARIABLE":["name","n?eFR1t?V*zZ8Fx24Nla",""]}},"q":{"opcode":"penguinGPT_singlePrompt","next":null,"parent":"d","inputs":{"PROMPT":[1,[10,"Make a random file name ending in .txt .txt will be automatically added to the end of what you say.
